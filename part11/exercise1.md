## CI Steps in JavaScript Ecosystem

In JavaScript, continuous integration involves the following steps:

1. **Linting:**
   - Use tools like ESLint to check coding style.

2. **Testing:**
   - Conduct various tests, including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests, using frameworks such as Jest, Mocha, or Jasmine.

3. **Building:**
   - Utilize build tools like Webpack, Babel, Rollup, Parcel, Grunt, or Gulp.

Would this setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment? Why? What information would you need to make that decision?

### Self-Hosted:

- High security
- Lower costs
- Small project scale

### Cloud-Hosted:

- Lower infrastructure expertise
- No hardware maintenance
- Future scalability needs

### Considerations:

- Budget
- Team skills
- Scale
- Expansion needs
